// Welcome to SpongeCast, a not  so simple yet simple broadcast plugin for Sponge made by Staz The Box.
// Below is the default configuration for how messages work. Each comment provides useful information that is also avaialble
// on the github page (http://git.stazthebox.cf/spongecast)

// A special note:
// Here are all the avaiable colours that you can provide in the format tag:
// 	black, blue, dark blue, aqua, dark aqua, gray (or grey), dark gray (or grey), green, dark green
// 	dark purple, light purple, red, dark red, gold, white, and yellow

// Here are all the avaiable styles that you can provide in the format tag:
// italics, bold, strike (or strikethrough), underline, and obfuscated (or random)

messages: {

	groupNumberOne: {
		// Change the message order of the current group.
		// Choose Between:
		// next - each individual message must have a next tag telling Sponge which message to send next
		// round - each message goes in a circle from first to last and back to first.
		// random - a random message is selected and sent.
    mode: "next"

		// The prefix is attached to the beginning of every message.
		// Note that there is no spacing by default in-between the prefix and the actual message, which is why there is a
		// space at the end of the prefix.
		prefix: "&4[&3SpongeCast&4] "

		// The suffix is attached to the end of every message.
		suffix: "."

		// Each message can have a specialized format, but each individual message can override
		// that formatting with it's own formats.
		// The color or colour tag can use any colour as defined above.
		// The style tag can use any style as defined above. More than one style can be applied at the same time simple by
		// putting a space in-between each style (as shown).
		format: {color: "red", style: "bold italics"}

		// This is where the individual messages are written.
    messages: [
			{

				// This tells SpongeCast that it should move onto the 2nd message after finishing up with this one.
				// This has no effect unless the mode is set to "next"
				next: 2

				// The pre delay will wait an X amount of seconds before sending the message.
				pre-delay: 5

				// This part actually defines the message that will be written. Each message must contain it's own
				message: "Hello I am a message! Please write things here in order for me to be more useful :(."

				// The post delay will wait an X amount of seconds before moving onto the next message (and their pre-delay)
				post-delay: 5

				// If the permission is set, then only folks with this permission will get the message
				// Without a permission plugin it will not work.
				permission: "i.am.a.permission"
			}

			// Below is the beginning of another message, notice the brackets.
			{
				// This tells SpongeCast to go back to the 1st message after finishing up with this one.
				// Again, no effect unless the mode is set to next
				next: 1

				// This does the same as the pre-delay, as in it will wait five seconds before moving on.
				delay: 5

				// Below the message is written in JSON format.
				// JSON allows you to insert buttons, tooltips, etc... in your chat messages.
				// This is a more advanced feature of Minecraft but visit https://www.minecraftjson.com
				// for the basic formatting. Please note that use must only provide the JSON code and not any commands.
				json: "{\"text\":\"I am Staz!\",\"color\":\"dark_blue\",\"bold\":true}"

	// Notice how I have another group here.
	// This will run independently of the other group. This allows for more complicated assignments.
	// Also notice how not all the information has to exist in order for it to function.
